First version of a personal project, challange from FrontendMentor website. Fully Responsive, optimalized for  mobile devices. Only "Connect" button in main menu is clickable for now, need to do more Javascript research to understand how to close div opened with onclick function when not hovering. Hopefully solving these problems in future updates.

The base resolution of the design is 1440px, in my opinion website looks the best at 1024px and below. Not tested for 1440px and above.

Definitely a fun challenge from FrontendMentor.
